Question 1:
It is the SnappingSheetController class, and it is used for controling the Snapping Sheet,
it allows us as programmers to control the position of the sheet in different situations,
when dragged or tapped on for example, using its snapPositions and snapToPosition properties to do
so.

Question 2:
The SnappingSheet class has a snapPositions Property which is a list that holds the diffrent
snapping positions for the SheetBelow


Question 3:
InkWell and GestureDetector provide more or less the same features, except that GestureDetector is
more broad and can provide more complex options, and that the InkWell must be wrapped in a material
widget.
The advantage of GestureDetector over InkWell is that it provides more gestures and that it does not
need to have a Material ancestor,on the other hand, InkWell is a rectangle area of Material that
responds to ink splashes,so it has effects such as ripple effect tap and other ink related features
that are not found in GestureDetector.
